Formula Evaluation in Spreadsheet
=================================

Build on or modify the MVC implementation and the parser
code posted to design the evaluation of formulas in a
spreadsheet.

1. Define a formula expression language which includes
reference to addresses in the spreadsheet and arbitrary
operations on Formulas which could be arbitrarily nested.

2. Implement the parser for the parser language whose concrete syntax is 

<Exp>  ::= <number> | <Addr>  | (<op> <Exp>*)
<Addr> ::= <Alpha>+ <Integer>
<Alpha> ::= [a-z]  | [A-Z]

<op>   ::= <Identifer>
<Identifier> ::= <Starting><More>*
<Starting>   ::= <Alpha> | <Special>

<Special>    ::= + - * 0 %
<More>       ::= <Starting> |<number>

<N>+ means one  or more of <N>
<N>* means zero or more of <N>
|  means choice


3. Implement a formula evaluator for a cell.  The evaluator
takes a concrete formula and parses it into the formula
expression's AST.


4. Implement a Graphical user interface for the spreadsheet:

-- By default the cell's result value should be shown. The
   initial value of each cell is 0.

-- Double clicking the cell should reveal the cell's
   formula, ready for editing.

-- After editing is over (signalled by a return key), the
   cell shows the result of evaluation of the formula.

-- Errors (invalid formulas, etc.) must be suitably handled.


5. If any assumptions/simplifications/approximations need to
be made by you, please document these and justify why they
are reasonable and why you needed to make them.
